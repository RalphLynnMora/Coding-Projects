**Machine Learning projects** This is a variety of reports revolving around support vector machines (SVM) and Gaussian process regressors and prediction models

**Runescape Bot** - Runescape is a game that requires a lot of repetitive task, So I created an automated bot to train my farming skill because I didn't enjoy doing it. the bot consist of searching portions of the screen for                      ceratin pixel colors, moving the mouse in a slow zigzag pattern to the desired color. clicking on it, and restarting the process all over about 20 times. I incorporated a lot of random wait times to help                       avoid the games bot detection. I built the same bot using C and Java, but the pixel color search times for those languages took considerably longer and AutoIt seemed the most optimized for the task.
